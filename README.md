### Design Concept

This project is part of the FCC challenges within the Responsive Web Design section. The styles are from ClusterCSS, a minimal Sass framework developed by myself. All the Sass code is compiled into CSS using Gulp4 as a build tool.
A dark theme together with white text and a vibrant primary color, ensure "no distraction" for the user who needs to go through the document. The page is fully responsive.

The web page follows a clean and minimalistic design approach, focusing on simplicity and clarity. It utilizes a dark color scheme with white text to create a visually appealing and modern aesthetic. Let's dive into the various sections and components of the page:

Header Section:

The page starts with a header section containing the title and a brief description of the project.
The title "type is plain object" is displayed prominently, followed by a paragraph explaining the purpose of the JavaScript utility.
The header section also includes a button labeled "view on GitHub," which serves as a direct link to the GitHub repository of the project.
Navigation:

The navigation section is represented by a horizontal menu bar located below the header.
It consists of several links that allow users to quickly navigate to different sections within the page.
The available navigation links include "Installation," "Usage," "Custom Build," "Contributing," "Author," and "License."
Main Content:

The main content area is divided into different sections, each addressing a specific topic related to the JavaScript utility.
The sections are arranged vertically and follow a consistent layout throughout the page.
Each section has a header with a title, presented in a clear and concise manner.

Installation Section:

This section provides instructions for installing the utility.
It includes two articles: "Using the Node Package Manager (NPM)" and "Or referencing the .js or .min.js file through a script tag."
Each article contains a description and a code block illustrating the installation process.

Usage Section:

The usage section explains how to use the JavaScript utility.
It provides two articles: "In Node (CommonJS)" and "Or in the Browser (ES6 modules)."
Similar to the installation section, each article includes a description and a code block demonstrating the usage.

Examples:

Within the usage section, there is a subsection with examples showcasing the utility in action.
The examples are presented in a code block, demonstrating the expected output for different input scenarios.
Custom Build Section:

This section guides users through the process of creating a custom build of the utility.
It provides a step-by-step explanation of the custom build process, including downloading the repository, running commands, and referencing the generated files.

Contributing Section:

The contributing section encourages users to contribute to the project.
It includes a brief message inviting users to submit pull requests if they encounter any issues.

Author Section:

The author section provides information about the project's maintainer.
It mentions the maintainer's name and provides a link to their GitHub profile.

License Section:

The license section states the licensing details for the project.
It specifies that the project is licensed under the MIT License and includes a link to the full license text.
Overall, the web page presents information about the "type is plain object" JavaScript utility in a clear and structured manner. The design prioritizes readability and ease of navigation, making it easy for users to understand the utility's purpose, install it, and explore its usage. The consistent use of code blocks enhances the technical presentation of the content, catering to the target audience of developers.
