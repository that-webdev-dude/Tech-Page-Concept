# Tech Page

### Design Concept

This is a technical documentation page about a real [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) package named [type-is-plain-object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-is-plain-object), an NPM package
developed and mantained by myself.

The web page follows a clean and minimalistic design approach, focusing on simplicity and clarity.
A dark theme together with white text and a vibrant primary color, creates a modern aesthetic ensuring "no distraction" for the user who needs to go through the document.
The styles are from [ClusterCSS](www.google.com), a minimal Sass framework developed by myself.

The title "type is plain object" is displayed prominently, followed by a paragraph explaining the purpose of the JavaScript utility.
The header section also includes a button labeled "view on GitHub," which serves as a direct link to the GitHub repository of the project.

The navigation consists of several links that allow users to quickly navigate to different sections within the page.

The main content area is divided into different sections, each addressing a specific topic related to the JavaScript utility.
The sections are arranged vertically and follow a consistent layout throughout the page.
Each section has a header with a title, presented in a clear and concise manner.

The design prioritizes readability and ease of navigation, making it easy for users to understand the utility's purpose, install it, and explore its usage.
The consistent use of code blocks enhances the technical presentation of the content, catering to the target audience of developers.
The page is fully responsive and suitable to be viewed on all devices.
